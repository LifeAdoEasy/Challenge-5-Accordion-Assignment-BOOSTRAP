                This program is a 6-Month Immersive Bootcamp which affords the
                opportunity for individual to eat, sleep and dream code everyday
                without distraction, in the midst of other determined developers
                like themselves away from family, work or distractions. This
                approach provides a shorter learning path to becoming a
                succesful software engineer and securing a job.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have two different programs at ITSKillsCenter. Regular
                programs and A 6-Month Immersive Bootcamp. You can pay for our

                Immersive Bootcamp. Both programs offer you the opportunity to
                future-proof your career and become ready to work as a

                You will go through two interviews. The first is a technical
                interview to access your cognitive abilites while the second
                interview will access your behavior and attitude. Once you
                succeed in both interviews, you will be required to pick a
                financing option.

                Yes, this is strictly onsite and physical. It is a bootcamp,
                meaning, you will camp with other like-minds eating, drinking
                and dreaming code for 6months. The program runs from Monday -

                You cannot combine this with your work, school or any other
